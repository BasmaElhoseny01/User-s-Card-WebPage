# User's-Card-WebPage
This is my first React JS project ðŸ¤—. I used Components and props to prevent code repetition.

## This is my first step in the world of React JS. I will build More Generous projects using ReactðŸ˜‰

This web page is my thord task in web development Course offered by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BetaAcademy.B">Beta Academy</a>.

The main page to run is index.js

## ðŸ”¨Built Using
<img height="40" src="https://cdn0.iconfinder.com/data/icons/logos-brands-in-colors/128/react-1024.png" />

## Screen Shot

### Notes:
 â€¢ The buttons in the header are links but are directed to nothing. Only the links in the footer are directed to my social media accounts.
 â€¢ The Counter for the No of users in the header is calculated automatically. ie if a user is removed the counter is decremented by 1 automatically.
